# Simple Blog API

First of all, you need to download the packages using command `npm i`

To execute the project you need to write `npm start` on terminal and go live server

There are five requests that you can do.
```
• POST /blogs: To create a new blog post. 
• GET /blogs: To retrieve all blog posts. 
• GET /blogs/:id: To retrieve a single blog post by ID. 
• PUT /blogs/:id: To update a blog post by ID. 
• DELETE /blogs/:id: To delete a blog post by ID.
```

All of them and also the connection to **MongoDB** are in the the `server.js` file. 

The front-end side of the project is in the `index.js` file
